# uap design document

# coding style
* use python3 / pep8 standard
* descriptive comment header at top of each file with author
and short description of the purpose of the module at the bottom
* use type hinting (new in python3!) to help show to others what the 
input / output types of each function is
* (preferably) unittests for each module at the bottom, these help
ensure that our code works and provide examples of how it is to be
used in place.
