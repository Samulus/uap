<h2>Cody Partin:</h2>
<blockquote>
    I'm working on a degree in Informatics as well as a certificate in Computer
    Gaming at Arizona State University. Ever since I got my hands on my first
    console, my father's Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) I've been a part
    time gamer in everything I've done. At some point, I got interested in how
    these things that were entertaining me for hours on end were created, and
    that lead me to my degree and certificate choices. Along the way, I learned
    to love coding in general, and have teamed up with these guys to both
    create something we can be proud of, and flex my coding muscles.

<h2>Samuel Vargas:</h2>

    I'm an undergraduate student at Arizona State University majoring in
    Informatics! I grew up on rhythm games and I've always found the
    intersection of software and music incredibly fascinating. So I'm
    especially excited to be working on this project. I work with a myriad of
    programming languages like D, C/C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript so I'm
    confident I can use my existing knowledge to make uap's backend rock solid!

<h2>Sean McGonegle</h2>
<blockquote>
    As an undergrad informatics student here at ASU, this project seemed like
    an excellent way to flex my programming capabilities. The subject interests
    me as music fuels most of my life, so any application to make music more
    accessible is a great thing. My languages only extend to C++, Java, and
    Javascript, but I am confident in them enough to be a positive contribution
    to this team.

    I am a Computer Science (Software Engineering) major with a minor in math.
    I am really looking forward to getting to work with Python, as well as
    working on a project with a group. My coding is primarily centered around
    C/C++, Java, and C# and this is the first time I've gotten to work on a
    project with a group larger than two people. I think this project will
    develop our teamwork skills as well as force us to go out and teach
    ourselves new material outside of the classroom which I think is the most
    important skill for any STEM major to have!I am a Computer Science
