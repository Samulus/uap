<h2>What is uap?</h2>
<p>
    uap is server software that allows you to stream your music collection to any computer with a modern web browser
    and an internet connection.
</p>

<h2>Why are we creating it?</h2>

<p>
    The team decided that this was a problem that many people may have and after studying the existing programs
    out there we came to the conclusion that there wasn't a good alternative available.
</p>

<h2>Problems with existing software</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Ampache (<a href="http://ampache.org/">http://ampache.org/</a>)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Excellent software but not portable enough, requires entire LAMP stack to get running</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Spotify (<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/">https://www.spotify.com/us/</a>)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Proprietary: could disappear at any moment</li>
        <li>Advertisements in free plan</li>
        <li>DRM-laden</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Subsonic (<a href="http://www.subsonic.org/">http://www.subsonic.org/</a>)</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Good but monolithic: tries to do everything, not just music</li>
        <li>No longer open source</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Grooveshark (...)</li>
    <ul>
        DMCA'd to death =\
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Functional backend (SQLite3 / taglib / bottle.py completely integrated)</li>
    <li>Barebones client (enough to view a list of songs and play each)</li>
    <li>Client with view by Artist support</li>
    <li>Client with view by Album support</li>
    <li>Client with view by Genre support</li>
    <li>Client with view by Year support</li>
    <li>Client with search support</li>
    <li>Jukebox support in the backend</li>
    <li>Jukebox support in the client</li>
    <li>WebGL music visualizations and other fun surprises</li>
</ol>

<h2>Use Case Analysis</h2>

<p>
    The primary use case for our program are people who wish to stream their music to their various devices
    while they're away from home without having to juggle multiple copies of their entire music library
    across devices.
</p>

<p>
    If time permits we also wish to include a "jukebox" mode where instead of music being streamed to a specific
    client, the client(s) get to play music on the server. This would be useful at a party and would allow
    multiple people to vote for music to enqueue etc.
</p>

<h2>Database Design</h2>
We intend to use SQLite3 with a few tables for Artists / Albums / Songs to maximize performance
and portability.

<h2> Project Plan</h2>

<table style="width:65%">

    <tr>
        <th>Task</th>
        <th>Week</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Integrate SQLite3 into rest of backend</td>
        <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Establish API for Server <-> Client communication</td>
        <td>2</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Get client to barebones working state</td>
        <td>3</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Add support for various music views (artist / album / genre / year)</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Add search support to client</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Add jukebox support to server / client</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>WebGL / fun stuff</td>
        <td>7</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<h2> Time Dependent Features</h2>
<p>
    At a bare minimum we intend to support streaming music to multiple clients who are connected
    at once.
</p>

<p>
    The list of features that will be added / removed depending on time is exactly the same: If we have enough time
    we will add support for jukebox mode and potentially music visualizations. Otherwise these features will be omitted
    from the final project.
